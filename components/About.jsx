                                    I am an Applied Math major-turned-developer based in New York City with a passion for open source projects, 
                                    data visualization, and learning new technologies and frameworks. <br></br><br></br>
                                    
                                    During and after graduating from Northwestern University with a BS in Applied Math and a concentration in Optimization, 
                                    I worked for nearly four years at the NYC-based nonprofit fundraising and development consulting firm Koszyn & Company. 
                                    Motivated my interests in data analysis, science communication, and problem solving I completed an accelerated full-stack 
                                    Software Engineering Program at Hackbright Academy. <br></br><br></br>
                                                                        
                                    Bolstered by my years in nonprofit development, I am interested in projects prioritizing social change, open-access information, 
                                    and responsible AI. <br></br><br></br>
